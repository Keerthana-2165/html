This is an assignment. We are not sharing the source code for this document- you’ll have to look
up the titles of each section (Overleaf is a great source), and try to replicate the features we
demonstrate the best you can.
Don’t forget to give yours ID when you submit the .file !
We recommend you attempt this assignment in the online Overleaf editor for the most
convenient workflow. The MacTeX distribution has all packages installed.
Some of the packages might give you troubles in your offline LATEX distribution, if so, you can
switch over to Overleaf.
Your submission should contain a zip containing

\section{Knitting Patterns}
This class provides a very convenient way to introduce boxed diagrams. We are thus going to use our stock image a few more times. Also, it has a few features to make knitting instructions more readable, however, we can adapt them to make.

instructions. Feel free to choose whatever background and border colour you like when
you replicate these features, but try to replicate the dimensions as well as you can.}

\note{colour0}{colour3}{Note}{This is a note. The above feature was introduced to typeset a sequence of knitting instructions.
 The first column is for the instruction, the second for the number of stitches.
 But hey, it looks
cool!}

\introleft{index1.png}{Look at the adjoining graph. Yes, you’ve seen it before. This
time, it is side by side with a paragraph! And there’s a beau-
tiful box around it! By default, this will be a quarter of the
width of the page. If you follow the hint that is the title of
this section, you won’t have to type in cumbersome code to
fit in images. Also, have you noticed that the pages are much
wider? A lot of it will be clear when you read up on the knit-
tingpatterns class. It is already available with the MacTeX
distributions, and of course, online on Overleaf. If your distri-
bution does not offer it, download it from here and copy the .cls
file to the folder/directory your code is in. See the point where
stuff becomes exponentially harder to do without L A TEX? Wedaresay the rest of this assignment crosses that point. Good
luck!}
